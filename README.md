# Links Per Page

A simple YOURLS plugin that lets you configure the number of links displayed per page from the admin interface. The **Links Per Page** plugin allows you to change the number of links displayed in the YOURLS admin dashboard. Instead of being locked to the default value (15), you can update this number using a dedicated configuration page.

## Features

- **Customizable Links Per Page:** Set a custom number of links to display on each admin page.
- **User-Friendly Configuration:** Update the number via an intuitive admin page.
- **Input Validation:** Only accepts numerical values between 1-999.
- **Feedback Messages:** Displays a green success message when updated or a red error message if something goes wrong.

## Requirements

- YOURLS (Version 1.9.x or later is recommended)
- PHP 7.4 or later (tested with PHP 8.3)

## Installation

  1. Download or Clone the Repository
  2. Upload to YOURLS: Copy the plugin folder to your YOURLS plugins directory, typically located at ```/user/plugins/```.
  3. Activate the Plugin: Log in to your YOURLS admin area, go to the Plugins page, and activate the **Links Per Page** plugin.

## Usage

  Once activated, the plugin adds a new configuration page in the YOURLS admin area. To update the number of links per page:
  1. Navigate to the pluginâ€™s configuration page: ```<YOURLS-SITE-DOMAIN>/admin/plugins.php?page=lpp_config```
  2. Enter the desired number (only numerical values, between 1-999) in the input field.
  3. Click Save.
  4. A success message in green will be displayed below the form if the update was successful, or an error message in red if the update failed.
